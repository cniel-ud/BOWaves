    "An outline of how this works:\n",
    "1. Load all emotion dataset, and chunk it into 30 second intervals (note - time increment doesn't matter, as long as it's consistent. But I'll stick with what they chose in their demo for now).\n",
    "2. Load all cue dataset, and chunk it into 30 second intervals.\n",
    "3. Fit the CMMN to the emotion dataset, then transform the cue dataset.\n",
    "4. Reconstruct the cue dataset into its original form of ICs per subj.\n",
    "5. Use the emotion clf on the cue dataset, take conf matrix.\n",
    "5a. Additionally, take PSD and count vectors of cue before and after CMMN."

    "CMMN is hosted by the authors on a github repo. As far as I can tell, it's not set up to be installed with pip or other package managers.\n",
    "So clone the repo in your IDE, and then just branch up and come down into the other directory to import the cmmn module.\n",
    "It may also be easier to use absolute imports, as I've done here, although this isn't best practice - I'll fix it later."
