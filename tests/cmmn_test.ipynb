    "The goal is that this will improve the performance of the clf we've trained on the emotion dataset when applied to the cue dataset, even though the confusion matrix won't line up perfectly (rectangular, with slightly different classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "An outline of how this works:\n",
    "1. Load all emotion dataset, and chunk it into 30 second intervals (note - time increment doesn't matter, as long as it's consistent. But I'll stick with what they chose in their demo for now).\n",
    "2. Load all cue dataset, and chunk it into 30 second intervals.\n",
    "3. Fit the CMMN to the emotion dataset, then transform the cue dataset.\n",
    "4. Reconstruct the cue dataset into its original form of ICs per subj.\n",
    "5. Use the emotion clf on the cue dataset, take conf matrix.\n",
    "5a. Additionally, take PSD and count vectors of cue before and after CMMN."
